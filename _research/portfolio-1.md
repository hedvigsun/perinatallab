In genome-wide association studies we investigate genetic code of thousands of mothers and their children in order to find the genes that play role in determining the duration of gestation. The knowledge of such genes can explain the biology behind the timing of birth and parturition mechanisms. In gene-environment interaction studies we try to identify women whose genetic profile makes their gestation extremely sensitive to common environmental exposures, such as caffeine intake, smoking, vitamins, microelements, probiotic products. Such women should receive personalized recommendations for their diet and supplements use during pregnancy.
